# Syllabus Pretty Printing

This is a simple script to pretty print the syllabus for a course. It takes a syllabus in the form of a text file and outputs a pdf file with the syllabus in a more readable format.

## Usage
To use the script, simply run the following command:
`python3 main.py`

The script will prompt you for the name of the file you want to convert. The file should be in the same directory as the script. The script will then prompt you for the name of the file you want to output. The output file will be in the same directory as the script.
